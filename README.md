# **AbstrakTS**

Welcome to AbstrakTS, and get ready for time series forecasting.

## **Overview**

AbstrakTS, abbreviated ATS, is a Python package for handling time series forecast developed by Rizal Purnawan under project Abstrak.

The mathematical framework of ATS is inspired by a technique in time series analysis known as SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average).

ATS uses well-known machine learning libraries implemented in its architecture such as linear regression from Scikit-Learn as well as ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) from Keras.

## **Technical Documentation**

A comprehensive techincal documentation for this project is hosted on Research Gate. Formal mathematical frameworks underlining the algorithms within AbstrakTS are presented in the documentation.
Please visit the following link to access the full documentation:

## **Contributors**

Currently, the sole contributor of AbstrakTS and project Abstrak as a whole is Rizal Purnawan.

## **Importing AbstrakTS**

Currently, the sole module in `abstrakTS` is `AbstrakTS`, a Python class containing all the machinery for handling time series forecast. Follow the command below to import the module into your notebook or local machine:

1. First, install the package using the following command:
```
!pip install git+https://github.com/rizalpurnawan23/AbstrakTS.git
```
2. Then import `AbstrakTS` using the following command:
```
from abstrakTS.abstrakTS import AbstrakTS
```
